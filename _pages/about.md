Hey there! I'm Muhammad Awwab Khan, and I'm on a tech adventure at [NED University of Engineering and Technology](https://www.neduet.edu.pk/). Even though I'm just 17, I'll be hitting the big 18 on April 28th – an exciting step in my academic journey!

I am deeply passionate about the vast realms of technology, with a keen interest in data science, machine learning, deep learning, and artificial intelligence. My enthusiasm is evident in my choice of tools, as I proficiently utilizes [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) for my machine learning projects. I embarked on my data science journey in July 2023, [showcasing](https://www.datacamp.com/portfolio/marhamkhank) a remarkable learning curve in a relatively short period. 

In addition to my academic pursuits, I am an avid problem solver, actively engaging in platforms like [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/profile/mawwabkhank2006) and [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/mawwabkhank2006/) to hone my algorithmic skills. My love for mathematics, particularly in the domains of calculus and statistics, complements my analytical mindset, providing a solid foundation for my data science endeavors.

But hey, life isn't just about coding and algorithms. I'm a football fanatic – nothing beats kicking the ball around with my buddies. It's the perfect balance between the virtual and real world, you know?

I'm not just a tech geek; I'm also fluent in English and Urdu. Good communication is key, right?

So, keep an eye out for Muhammad Awwab Khan – I'm making waves in the software engineering and data science scene. It's all about the journey, and I'm loving every bit of it!
